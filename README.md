Showcasing My Python & SQL Portfolio Project: E-commerce Data Analysis

I'm excited to share a recent project where I delved into a comprehensive e-commerce dataset using Python and SQL to extract valuable business insights. This project allowed me to apply my data analysis skills to real-world scenarios, focusing on key metrics and trends.

Here are some of the quantitative insights I uncovered:

1.
Order Volume in 2017: A significant 90,202 orders were processed in 2017, highlighting a robust operational year.

2.
Dominant Product Category: The 'BED TABLE BATH' category emerged as the top performer, contributing a substantial 42.79% to the total sales revenue.

3.
High Installment Payment Adoption: An overwhelming 99.9981% of orders were paid through installments, indicating a strong consumer preference for flexible payment options.

4.
Weak Price-Purchase Correlation: My analysis revealed a very weak negative correlation (-0.1063) between product price and the number of times a product was purchased, suggesting that price isn't a primary driver for purchase frequency in this dataset.

5.
Impressive Year-over-Year Sales Growth: The e-commerce platform experienced remarkable growth, with sales increasing by 12112.70% from 2016 to 2017, and a further 20.00% from 2017 to 2018.
